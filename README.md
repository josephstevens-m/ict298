# ICT298 Cisco Certification Information.
Cisco Certificates
These are the Cisco Certificates that we have available. You have two choices here. You could take the Cisco Networking Essentials or the Skillsforall Cybersecurity track. These are slightly different than the Microsoft Certifications. Once you pass you will receive a badge that you can put on your linkedin and certification is sent to you. The exam is not administered by a 3rd party organisation as with Microsoft. Murdoch University will be administering the final exam. 

## Cisco NetAcad – Networking Essentials
This is quite advanced and in depth. I only recommend you taking this if you are serious about networking and you are dedicating enough time to do this. This would equate to doing two MS certs.
